# Traffic Volume Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict traffic volume on roadways based on various factors such as time of day, temperature, and day of the week.
Accurate traffic volume prediction can be invaluable for urban planning, traffic management, and transportation infrastructure optimization.
By forecasting traffic volume, authorities can better allocate resources, plan road maintenance, and improve overall traffic flow.

## Project Steps
1. Data Collection: The dataset contains information about traffic volume recorded at different times of the day, along with various
   environmental and temporal factors.

2. Data Exploration and Visualization: The dataset was thoroughly explored to gain insights into its structure and underlying patterns.
    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to visualize relationships between features, identify trends, and detect
   outliers. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

3. Feature Engineering: To enhance model performance, new features were engineered from existing ones. This involved transforming
   variables, creating interaction terms, and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding,
   binning, and scaling were applied to prepare the data for model training.

4. Model Building : Several machine learning models were developed to predict traffic volume. Various algorithms, including XGBoost,
   Random Forest, and Linear Regression, were experimented with to find the best performing model. Hyperparameter tuning and
   cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation and Selection: Model performance was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error
   (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Models were compared based on their performance on validation datasets, and the best
   performing model was selected for deployment.

6. Model Deployment: The selected model was deployed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to create a user-friendly web
   application. The Flask application allows users to input parameters such as hour of the day, temperature, and day of the week to
   obtain real-time predictions of traffic volume.
